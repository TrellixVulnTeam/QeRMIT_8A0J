A site atop the Raisina Hill, formerly Raisina Village, a Meo village, was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy's House. The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel, which was also considered the site of Indraprastha, the ancient region of Delhi.

The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has some responsibility for offering variety in what we eat?", "id": "570bc5976b8089140040fa26", "answers": [{"text": "Interspecific crop diversity", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the variety of alleles within a single species?", "id": "570bc5976b8089140040fa27", "answers": [{"text": "Interspecific crop diversity", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When do we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new?", "id": "570bc5976b8089140040fa28", "answers": [{"text": "If a crop fails in a monoculture", "answer_start": 200}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What can destroy a wheat crop?", "id": "570bc5976b8089140040fa29", "answers": [{"text": "a pest", "answer_start": 340}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of a society primarily grows monocultures?", "id": "570bc5976b8089140040fa2a", "answers": [{"text": "agricultural society", "answer_start": 567}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Interspecific crop diversity", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What has some responsibility for offering variety in monoculture?", "id": "5a8cae40fd22b3001a8d8d2a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Intraspecific diversity", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "What is the variety of alleles within a single production area?", "id": "5a8cae40fd22b3001a8d8d2b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "If a crop fails in a monoculture", "answer_start": 200}], "question": "When do we rely on production diversity to replant the land with something new?", "id": "5a8cae40fd22b3001a8d8d2c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a pest", "answer_start": 340}], "question": "What can destroy a single species?", "id": "5a8cae40fd22b3001a8d8d2d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "agricultural society", "answer_start": 567}], "question": "What type of a society primarily grows wheat?", "id": "5a8cae40fd22b3001a8d8d2e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat.

In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, \"do invasive species cause extinctions?\" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline, and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, by introducing them for food and other purposes.

The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters left, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9. This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers\u2014\u200b\u200bfollowing the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984)\u2014\u200b\u200band thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did.

Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed. The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests. The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps (usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials) and grooming informants in order to monitor dissidents and \"troublemakers.\" After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was the Top Hoodlum Program a response to?", "id": "570c2effec8fbc190045bd52", "answers": [{"text": "organized crime", "answer_start": 15}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the Top Hoodlum Program gather information on?", "id": "570c2effec8fbc190045bd53", "answers": [{"text": "mobsters", "answer_start": 161}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After the RICO Act took effect what did the FBI start investigating?", "id": "570c2effec8fbc190045bd54", "answers": [{"text": "former Prohibition-organized groups", "answer_start": 412}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What groups did Hoover deny the existence of?", "id": "570c2effec8fbc190045bd55", "answers": [{"text": "National Crime Syndicate", "answer_start": 744}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Is the RICO Act still used today?", "id": "570c2effec8fbc190045bd56", "answers": [{"text": "The RICO Act is still used", "answer_start": 939}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "created the Top Hoodlum Program", "answer_start": 60}], "question": "How did the FBI respond to organized crime before 1953?", "id": "5ad37ff4604f3c001a3fe45b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "began investigating", "answer_start": 388}], "question": "What did the FBI do before the RICO Act took effect?", "id": "5ad37ff4604f3c001a3fe45c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "National Crime Syndicate", "answer_start": 744}], "question": "What did Hoover confirm the existence of?", "id": "5ad37ff4604f3c001a3fe45d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Sam Giancana", "answer_start": 910}], "question": "Who was the head of a crime family the CIA targeted?", "id": "5ad37ff4604f3c001a3fe45e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "RICO Act", "answer_start": 943}], "question": "What act is not longer in use?", "id": "5ad37ff4604f3c001a3fe45f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program.

Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland.

This process, known as the maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH), would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment.

That is to say, all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to \"melt down\" their own particular exilic identities within the general social \"pot\" in order to become Israeli."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by what concept?", "id": "571a616610f8ca1400305009", "answers": [{"text": "Yiddishkeit", "answer_start": 65}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does Yiddishkeit mean in the Yiddish language?", "id": "571a616610f8ca140030500a", "answers": [{"text": "\"Jewishness\"", "answer_start": 90}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In the past most Jews prayed in what language?", "id": "571a616610f8ca140030500b", "answers": [{"text": "liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew", "answer_start": 450}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In the past, while most Jews prayed in one language, they used which other language in their secular lives?", "id": "571a616610f8ca140030500c", "answers": [{"text": "Yiddish", "answer_start": 489}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Is there a larger or smaller number of Jews that speak Yiddish today than in the past?", "id": "571a616610f8ca140030500d", "answers": [{"text": "a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish", "answer_start": 771}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \"Jewishness\" in the Yiddish language.

In 1921, Canadian professor Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best repeated this study, and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal. Soon, the extract was demonstrated to work in people, but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity. The researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at Eli Lilly and Co. based on the company's experience with large scale purification of biological materials. Chemist George Walden of Eli Lilly and Company found that careful adjustment of the pH of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced. Under pressure from Toronto University and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method, an agreement was reached for non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies.

By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939?", "id": "571aaa3310f8ca14003052ad", "answers": [{"text": "Gerhard Domagk", "answer_start": 264}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who is responsible for creating Prontosil?", "id": "571aaa3310f8ca14003052ae", "answers": [{"text": "Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk", "answer_start": 230}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What causes Streptococci?", "id": "571aaa3310f8ca14003052af", "answers": [{"text": "pathogens", "answer_start": 623}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Many deaths occurred before World War II due to what?", "id": "571aaa3310f8ca14003052b0", "answers": [{"text": "infectious diseases", "answer_start": 778}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Prontosil is in what drug class?", "id": "571aaa3310f8ca14003052b1", "answers": [{"text": "antibiotics", "answer_start": 460}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the name of the first sulfonamine antibiotic?", "id": "571cf74cdd7acb1400e4c1d2", "answers": [{"text": "Prontosil", "answer_start": 396}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What award did Domagk receive in 1939?", "id": "571cf74cdd7acb1400e4c1d3", "answers": [{"text": "Nobel Prize in Medicine", "answer_start": 684}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Anti-infective drugs became more prominent after what war?", "id": "571cf74cdd7acb1400e4c1d4", "answers": [{"text": "World War II", "answer_start": 1021}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Were sulfonamides more or less toxic than arsphenamine?", "id": "571cf74cdd7acb1400e4c1d5", "answers": [{"text": "less", "answer_start": 564}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Streptococci and other pathogens could be treated by what type of antibiotics?", "id": "571cf74cdd7acb1400e4c1d6", "answers": [{"text": "sulfonamides", "answer_start": 503}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gerhard Domagk", "answer_start": 264}], "question": "Who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1938?", "id": "5ad36c34604f3c001a3fe199", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk", "answer_start": 230}], "question": "Who is responsible for creating German dye?", "id": "5ad36c34604f3c001a3fe19a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "pathogens", "answer_start": 623}], "question": "What causes Gerhard?", "id": "5ad36c34604f3c001a3fe19b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "infectious diseases", "answer_start": 778}], "question": "Many deaths occurred after World War II due to what?", "id": "5ad36c34604f3c001a3fe19c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antibiotics", "answer_start": 460}], "question": "Gerhard is in what drug class?", "id": "5ad36c34604f3c001a3fe19d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Ehrlich\u2019s approach of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring the effects of these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including Bayer scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk.

In 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery.

The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis.

This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs.

Searle & Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960.

Some approved drugs, such as those based on re-formulation of an existing active ingredient (also referred to as Line-extensions) are much less expensive to develop."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why was Mevastatin never marketed?", "id": "571ae94232177014007e9fda", "answers": [{"text": "adverse effects of tumors, muscle deterioration, and sometimes death", "answer_start": 535}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who discovered Mevastatin?", "id": "571ae94232177014007e9fdb", "answers": [{"text": "Akira Endo", "answer_start": 9}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is HMG-CoA responsible for producing?", "id": "571ae94232177014007e9fdc", "answers": [{"text": "cholesterol", "answer_start": 263}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where did Endo discover ML-236B?", "id": "571ae94232177014007e9fdd", "answers": [{"text": "Penicillium citrinum", "answer_start": 157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was discovered in long term studies?", "id": "571ae94232177014007e9fde", "answers": [{"text": "too toxic for human use", "answer_start": 464}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year was mevastatin discovered?", "id": "571d1e58dd7acb1400e4c224", "answers": [{"text": "1971", "answer_start": 3}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who discovered mevastatin?", "id": "571d1e58dd7acb1400e4c225", "answers": [{"text": "Akira Endo", "answer_start": 9}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What organism produces mevastatin?", "id": "571d1e58dd7acb1400e4c226", "answers": [{"text": "Penicillium citrinum", "answer_start": 157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What enzyme helps produce cholesterol?", "id": "571d1e58dd7acb1400e4c227", "answers": [{"text": "HMG-CoA reductase", "answer_start": 198}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "adverse effects of tumors, muscle deterioration, and sometimes death", "answer_start": 535}], "question": "Why was Penicillium never marketed?", "id": "5ad389c2604f3c001a3fe595", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Akira Endo", "answer_start": 9}], "question": "Who discovered Penicillium?", "id": "5ad389c2604f3c001a3fe596", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Penicillium citrinum", "answer_start": 157}], "question": "What is Penicillium responsible for producing?", "id": "5ad389c2604f3c001a3fe597", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "too toxic for human use", "answer_start": 464}], "question": "What was discovered in short term studies?", "id": "5ad389c2604f3c001a3fe598", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1971", "answer_start": 3}], "question": "In what year was Penicillium discovered?", "id": "5ad389c2604f3c001a3fe599", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In 1971, Akira Endo, a Japanese biochemist working for the pharmaceutical company Sankyo, identified mevastatin (ML-236B), a molecule produced by the fungus Penicillium citrinum, as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a critical enzyme used by the body to produce cholesterol.

Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug.

The development and approval of generics is less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price. Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a generic version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market.

The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted, that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting public domain works, limitations and exceptions to copyright, or uses allowed by the copyright holder.

The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire.

In the 1880s, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that \"the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.\" In 1888, Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.  The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor. The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower (HP) induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What would a rotor do without current reversal?", "id": "5726aad5708984140094cd5d", "answers": [{"text": "brake to a stop", "answer_start": 493}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What switches the input of most DC motors?", "id": "5726aad5708984140094cd5e", "answers": [{"text": "commutator", "answer_start": 2}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "From where is current to the motor supplied?", "id": "5726aad5708984140094cd5f", "answers": [{"text": "stationary brushes", "answer_start": 246}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What two motor types are ascendant today?", "id": "5726aad5708984140094cd60", "answers": [{"text": "externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet", "answer_start": 768}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "brake to a stop", "answer_start": 493}], "question": " What would a rotor do with current reversal?", "id": "5ad15d84645df0001a2d18c8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "commutator", "answer_start": 295}], "question": " What switches the output of most DC motors?", "id": "5ad15d84645df0001a2d18c9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "stationary brushes", "answer_start": 246}], "question": "From where is current to the motor not supplied?", "id": "5ad15d84645df0001a2d18ca", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet motors", "answer_start": 768}], "question": " What two motor types are descendant today?", "id": "5ad15d84645df0001a2d18cb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "A commutator is a mechanism used to switch the input of most DC machines and certain AC machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated from each other and from the electric motor's shaft.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.

The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing.

The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: \"On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\" Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent.

As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place.

The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience.

Thus Newton's laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific \"the solar system has seven planets\".[dubious \u2013 discuss]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Popper believed he had already discussed similar ideas to Kuhn's about scientific communities in what work?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b5", "answers": [{"text": "Logic of Discovery", "answer_start": 69}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What aspect of Kuhn's thinking did Popper criticize?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b6", "answers": [{"text": "relativism", "answer_start": 339}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Popper say must be the beginning phase of science?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b7", "answers": [{"text": "the critical discussion of myths", "answer_start": 635}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "According to Popper, what second layer does scientific inquiry have that pre-scientific inquiry does not?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b8", "answers": [{"text": "a critical attitude", "answer_start": 874}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1934", "answer_start": 49}], "question": "What year did Kuhn stress \"that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework\"?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a42954e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Logic of Discovery", "answer_start": 69}], "question": "What book did Kuhn publish in 1934?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a42954f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "relativism", "answer_start": 339}], "question": "What did Kuhn criticize about Popper?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a429550", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the critical discussion of myths", "answer_start": 635}], "question": "What did Kuhn say must be the beginning phase of science?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a429551", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a critical attitude", "answer_start": 874}], "question": "According to Kuhn, what second layer does scientific inquiry have that pre-scientific inquiry does not?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a429552", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Popper claimed to have recognised already in the 1934 version of his Logic of Discovery a fact later stressed by Kuhn, \"that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework\", and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn's central point about \"normal science\".

Also, in his collection Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (Harper & Row, 1963), Popper writes, \"Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices.

These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category.

The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST \u2212 leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign.

The next 13 sultans from 1566 to 1703, with two exceptions, were lackadaisical or incompetent rulers, says Lee. In a highly centralized system, the failure at the center proved fatal.

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a \"blank tablet\", in Locke's words \"white paper\", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes.

According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences. Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist \u2014 hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the \"permanent possibility of sensation\". Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for all meaningful knowledge including mathematics. As summarized by D.W.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \"reality\" that goes beyond mere \"possibilities of sensation\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What phase of empiricism ended in the 1940s?", "id": "572b40d0111d821400f38df6", "answers": [{"text": "phenomenalist", "answer_start": 4}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How can't a finite set of statements be described?", "id": "572b40d0111d821400f38df7", "answers": [{"text": "in purely sensory terms", "answer_start": 736}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is necessary to explain a doctor's normality in sensory terms?", "id": "572b40d0111d821400f38df8", "answers": [{"text": "a second doctor", "answer_start": 1204}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1940s", "answer_start": 63}], "question": "When did the phenomenalist phase begin?", "id": "5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1940s", "answer_start": 63}], "question": "When was the problem of the third man published?", "id": "5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "purely sensory terms", "answer_start": 739}], "question": "How must a finite set of statements be described?", "id": "5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "we must refer to a third doctor", "answer_start": 1502}], "question": "How many doctors do you need to satisfy the hypothetical problem?", "id": "5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the former must be at least deducible from the latter", "answer_start": 307}], "question": "How did it become possible for physical object statements to translate into sense-data statements?", "id": "5a57d811770dc0001aeefdfe", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.

But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer.

This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called verification principle.

Plato was therefore a metaphysical and epistemological dualist, an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense, although quantum physics' assertion that man's consciousness is an immutable and primary requisite for not merely perceiving but shaping matter, and thus his reality, would give more credence to Plato's dualist position.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What sort of philosopher was Plotinus?", "id": "572b6d0fbe1ee31400cb837d", "answers": [{"text": "neoplatonist", "answer_start": 9}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "According to Noir\u00e9, who was the first true Western idealist?", "id": "572b6d0fbe1ee31400cb837e", "answers": [{"text": "Plotinus", "answer_start": 540}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What issue did Schopenhauer discuss that Plotinus did not?", "id": "572b6d0fbe1ee31400cb837f", "answers": [{"text": "whether we know external objects", "answer_start": 585}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the Enneads believe might not have existence outside of the soul?", "id": "572b6d0fbe1ee31400cb8380", "answers": [{"text": "Time", "answer_start": 398}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "neoplatonist", "answer_start": 9}], "question": "What type of philosopher was Nathaniel Alfred Boll?", "id": "5a7c71cbe8bc7e001a9e1dfb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ludwig Noir\u00e9", "answer_start": 451}], "question": "Who was one of the Enneads?", "id": "5a7c71cbe8bc7e001a9e1dfc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Schopenhauer", "answer_start": 626}], "question": "What modern philosopher as Plotinus similar to?", "id": "5a7c71cbe8bc7e001a9e1dfd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Enneads", "answer_start": 333}], "question": "Who said time existed outside of the soul?", "id": "5a7c71cbe8bc7e001a9e1dfe", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "stepping from eternity into time", "answer_start": 253}], "question": "Boll taught that the soul made the world by doing what?", "id": "5a7c71cbe8bc7e001a9e1dff", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "With the neoplatonist Plotinus, wrote Nathaniel Alfred Boll; \"there even appears, probably for the first time in Western philosophy, idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught... that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time...\".

When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God.

He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism esse est percipi, \"to be is to be perceived\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" are identical - \"to be yellow\" is \"to be experienced as yellow\".

Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as Black Hawk Down and Enemy at the Gates. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with Paramount Pictures (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the Indiana Jones series). Later, Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced a TV mini-series based on Stephen Ambrose's book Band of Brothers. The ten-part HBO mini-series follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.

Artificial Intelligence and The BFG. According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like Munich, Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal, Minority Report, and Amistad. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in Jaws are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In Empire of the Sun, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in Catch Me If You Can, Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was Indy's father's career?", "id": "5731cbbce99e3014001e6296", "answers": [{"text": "professor of medieval literature", "answer_start": 549}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What artifact did Indy's father focus on?", "id": "5731cbbce99e3014001e6297", "answers": [{"text": "the Holy Grail", "answer_start": 671}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is Spielberg's most common theme?", "id": "5731cbbce99e3014001e6298", "answers": [{"text": "tension in parent-child relationships", "answer_start": 50}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Whose son disappeared in 'Minority Report'?", "id": "5731cbbce99e3014001e6299", "answers": [{"text": "John Anderton", "answer_start": 1183}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Whose parents divorced in 'Catch Me If You Can'?", "id": "5731cbbce99e3014001e629a", "answers": [{"text": "Frank Abagnale", "answer_start": 1664}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Tim", "answer_start": 1994}], "question": "Who is one of the main characters of Jurassic Park?", "id": "5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2ac", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "father", "answer_start": 853}], "question": "What was Oskar Schindler in real life?", "id": "5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2ad", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "professor of medieval literature", "answer_start": 549}], "question": "What did Indiana Jones do for a living?", "id": "5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2ae", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "professor of medieval literature", "answer_start": 549}], "question": "What occupation was Avner in Munich?", "id": "5ad4d6215b96ef001a10a2af", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in Hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which Spielberg films has Dreyfuss been in?", "id": "5731cc2ce99e3014001e62a0", "answers": [{"text": "Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Always", "answer_start": 207}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was Ford going to play in E.T., until the scene was removed?", "id": "5731cc2ce99e3014001e62a1", "answers": [{"text": "a headteacher", "answer_start": 336}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which Spielberg TV shows has Frank Welker been a voice actor for?", "id": "5731cc2ce99e3014001e62a2", "answers": [{"text": "Tiny Toons, Animaniacs, and SeaQuest DSV", "answer_start": 789}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which Spielberg films has Tom Hanks been in?", "id": "5731cc2ce99e3014001e62a3", "answers": [{"text": "Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal, and Bridge of Spies", "answer_start": 901}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which Spielberg films has Tom Cruise been in?", "id": "5731cc2ce99e3014001e62a4", "answers": [{"text": "Minority Report and War of the Worlds", "answer_start": 1030}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Eagle Eye", "answer_start": 1120}], "question": "What was Shia LaBeouf's first film?", "id": "5ad4d70c5b96ef001a10a2e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gremlins", "answer_start": 652}], "question": "What movie was Frank Welker's first voicework?", "id": "5ad4d70c5b96ef001a10a2e5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jaws", "answer_start": 207}], "question": "What was Richard Dreyfuss' first film?", "id": "5ad4d70c5b96ef001a10a2e6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Harrison Ford", "answer_start": 319}], "question": "Who made a cameo in the finished version of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial?", "id": "5ad4d70c5b96ef001a10a2e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films.

However, the Constitution does not set a minimum size for the District. Its size has already changed once before, when Virginia reclaimed the portion of the District south of the Potomac.

The first invasion was during the Revolution, under the assumption that French-speaking Canadians' presumed hostility towards British colonial rule combined with the Franco-American alliance would make them natural allies to the American cause; the Continental Army successfully recruited two Canadian regiments for the invasion. That invasion's failure forced the members of those regiments into exile, and they settled mostly in upstate New York. The Articles of Confederation, written during the Revolution, included a provision for Canada to join the United States, should they ever decide to do so, without needing to seek U.S. permission as other states would. The United States again invaded Canada during the War of 1812, but this effort was made more difficult due to the large number of Loyalist Americans that had fled to what is now Ontario and still resisted joining the republic.

Specificity theory saw pain as \"a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses\". Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists.

Such glitches help explain pains which are not, or at least no longer directly adaptive (e.g. perhaps some forms of toothache, or injury to fingernails)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Along with with ethnicity and genetics, what is the other factor associated with differences in pain perception?", "id": "572f8ddea23a5019007fc735", "answers": [{"text": "sex", "answer_start": 123}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What might some people of Mediterranean origin report as painful that people of this origin wouldn't?", "id": "572f8ddea23a5019007fc736", "answers": [{"text": "Europeans", "answer_start": 221}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What nationality can tolerate the least amount of electric shock?", "id": "572f8ddea23a5019007fc737", "answers": [{"text": "Italian", "answer_start": 259}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal?", "id": "572f8ddea23a5019007fc738", "answers": [{"text": "pain perception", "answer_start": 419}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Patients who have painless heart attacks have higher what?", "id": "572f8ddea23a5019007fc739", "answers": [{"text": "pain thresholds", "answer_start": 534}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ethnicity, genetics, and sex", "answer_start": 98}], "question": "What are pain thresholds and tolerance perception associated with?", "id": "5acd415907355d001abf3a9c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jewish", "answer_start": 315}], "question": "Who do Native American women tolerate less intense electric shock than?", "id": "5acd415907355d001abf3a9d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "northern Europeans", "answer_start": 212}], "question": "Who do Italian woman report more painful radiant heat intensities than?", "id": "5acd415907355d001abf3a9e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with, among other factors, ethnicity, genetics, and sex.

Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways. Ren\u00e9 Descartes for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to \"prove\" that animals are conscious, and to provide \"scientifically acceptable\" grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. The ability of invertebrate species of animals, such as insects, to feel pain and suffering is also unclear."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What about pain in an animal isn't able to be known with certainty?", "id": "572faad8b2c2fd14005682e7", "answers": [{"text": "presence", "answer_start": 4}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "An animals physical and behavioral reactions may be inferred to indicate the presence of what?", "id": "572faad8b2c2fd14005682e8", "answers": [{"text": "pain", "answer_start": 16}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who do specialists believe can feel pain?", "id": "572faad8b2c2fd14005682e9", "answers": [{"text": "vertebrates", "answer_start": 168}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "No mechanism is known by which what organisms would be able to have a feeling such as pain?", "id": "572faad8b2c2fd14005682ea", "answers": [{"text": "plants", "answer_start": 278}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do fungi and fruit flies seem to lack?", "id": "572faad8b2c2fd14005682eb", "answers": [{"text": "nociceptors", "answer_start": 494}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The presence of pain", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What can be known for certain in animals?", "id": "5acd5ad807355d001abf3e92", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "pain", "answer_start": 189}], "question": "What do specialists say all invertebrates can feel?", "id": "5acd5ad807355d001abf3e93", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "nociceptors", "answer_start": 494}], "question": "What does a fruit fly not have?", "id": "5acd5ad807355d001abf3e94", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The presence of pain in an animal cannot be known for certain, but it can be inferred through physical and behavioral reactions.

For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \"Blood of Saint John\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \"Kermes\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz), made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii, an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which brightened the color."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what century did a new kind of red pigment arrive in Europe from the Aztec Empire?", "id": "573135b605b4da19006bcecc", "answers": [{"text": "16th", "answer_start": 17}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which conquistador from Spain conquered the Aztec Empire?", "id": "573135b605b4da19006bcecd", "answers": [{"text": "Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "During what years was the Aztec Empire conquered?", "id": "573135b605b4da19006bcece", "answers": [{"text": "1519-1521", "answer_start": 162}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How often could the Mexican cochineal be harvested?", "id": "573135b605b4da19006bcecf", "answers": [{"text": "several times a year", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Cortes send the first cochineal to Spain?", "id": "573135b605b4da19006bced0", "answers": [{"text": "1523", "answer_start": 677}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s", "answer_start": 101}], "question": "What Aztec conquistador conquered the Spanish Empire?", "id": "5ad4da955b96ef001a10a3f0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his soldiers conquered the Aztec Empire", "answer_start": 80}], "question": "What happened in 1519?", "id": "5ad4da955b96ef001a10a3f1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s", "answer_start": 101}], "question": "Who conquered the Spanish Empire in 1519-1521?", "id": "5ad4da955b96ef001a10a3f2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Cortes", "answer_start": 682}], "question": "Who sent the first shipment to Spain in 1532?", "id": "5ad4da955b96ef001a10a3f3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain.", "answer_start": 682}], "question": "What happened in 1532?", "id": "5ad4da955b96ef001a10a3f4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "But early in the 16th century, a brilliant new red appeared in Europe.

Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country.

The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \"family worship\". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a \"circuit\" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day \"regional convention\", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin\u2014usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines\u2014a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why do Jehovah Witnesses believe the Bible condemns mixing of religions?", "id": "57324e7a0fdd8d15006c694b", "answers": [{"text": "can only be one truth from God", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do Jehovah Witnesses believe is true of their religion and their religion alone?", "id": "57324e7a0fdd8d15006c694c", "answers": [{"text": "represents true Christianity", "answer_start": 229}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are Jehovah Witnesses taught it's vital to remain?", "id": "57324e7a0fdd8d15006c694d", "answers": [{"text": "\"separate from the world.\"", "answer_start": 415}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does Jehovah Witnesses define the \"world\" to mean?", "id": "57324e7a0fdd8d15006c694e", "answers": [{"text": "\"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah's approved servants\"", "answer_start": 491}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are Jehovah Witnesses taught association with worldly people presents to their faith?", "id": "57324e7a0fdd8d15006c694f", "answers": [{"text": "danger", "answer_start": 686}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jehovah's Witnesses", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What Protestant religion is open to talking with outsiders?", "id": "5ad3dacc604f3c001a3ff3c5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jehovah's Witnesses", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What Protestant religion encourage interacting with the broader world?", "id": "5ad3dacc604f3c001a3ff3c6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jehovah's Witnesses", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What Protestant group is fine with the mixing of religions?", "id": "5ad3dacc604f3c001a3ff3c7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jehovah's Witnesses", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What Protestant group thinks there can be many truths from God?", "id": "5ad3dacc604f3c001a3ff3c8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions, on the basis that there can only be one truth from God, and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements.

The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation.

Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont, Quebec, Ontario and Michigan. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea, including much of Finland.

The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school.
