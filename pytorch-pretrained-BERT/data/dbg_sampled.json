In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what century did important classical music developments occur in Normandy?", "id": "cec2ebac1cfae615a1a03c37b", "answers": [{"text": "11th", "answer_start": 97}, {"text": "the 11th", "answer_start": 93}, {"text": "11th", "answer_start": 97}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who were the two abbots at F\u00e9camp Abbey?", "id": "dde01eb8c4bfb806a56abcd8f", "answers": [{"text": "William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna", "answer_start": 234}, {"text": "William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna", "answer_start": 234}, {"text": "William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna", "answer_start": 234}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "classical music", "answer_start": 74}], "question": "What developed in Normandy during the 1100s?", "id": "af7ec421b12557da1ec515cec", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "musical composition", "answer_start": 632}], "question": "What was Fecamp Abby the center of?", "id": "475019d0f1eb99b5a6c5cbcbb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century.
